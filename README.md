# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

## Introduction

### This capstone project requires me to do a bike-share analysis case study. As a junior data analyst, I will be analyzing data for the marketing team in Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. It is my task to to come up with a proposal on how to convert casual riders to member riders in order to maximize the company's future success.

In order to realize the business task, six steps of data analysis were utilized to draw a conclusion. The six steps of data analysis are:
- Ask
- Prepare
- Process
- Analyze
- Share
- Act
